# Obsidian Journal Goals Template Framework
## Overview
This repository contains a framework for creating goals in Obsidian and having them flow from setting goals at the beginning of the year, dividing them into quarterly goals, and then into monthly goals, weekly goals, and finally daily goals. 
This framework is designed to help people who have many interests and want to pursue them all, but need a way to focus their time and energy, getting organised in a way that still allows large goal settings.
